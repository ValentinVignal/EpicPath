# Import it

```python
from epicpath import EpicPath as EPath
```

I actually already created some aliases for you, so you can do all the fallowing import to get the same object:

```python
from epicpath import EpicPath       # All these 3 imports are the same objects
from epicpath import EPath
from epicpath import EP
```

You also can access `Path` from `pathlib` :
```python
from epicpath import Path   # Path class
```
